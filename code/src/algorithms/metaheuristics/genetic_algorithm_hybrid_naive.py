"""Naive Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (ISO-Algorithmic Variant).

Individual GPU kernel launches with full D2H transfers.
This variant demonstrates the memory transfer bottleneck.

Architecture:
    - Selection, Crossover, Mutation: CPU (NumPy)
    - 2-opt improvement: GPU (256 individual kernel calls)
    - Fitness calculation: CPU (after D2H transfer)

Memory Transfer Pattern (per generation):
    - H2D: 256 tours × n cities × 4 bytes × 10 iterations = 10,240n bytes
    - D2H: 256 tours × n cities × 4 bytes × 10 iterations = 10,240n bytes
    - Total: 20,480n bytes per generation
    - Example (n=1000): ~20MB per generation
