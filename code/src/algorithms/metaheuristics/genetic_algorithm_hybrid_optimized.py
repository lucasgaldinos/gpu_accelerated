"""Optimized Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (ISO-Algorithmic Variant).

Batch GPU processing with kernel chaining for minimal memory transfer.
This variant demonstrates the Chapter 4 optimization.

Architecture:
    - Selection, Crossover, Mutation: CPU (NumPy)
    - 2-opt improvement: GPU (single batch kernel, all tours in parallel)
    - Fitness calculation: GPU (chained, no intermediate D2H)
    - Final transfer: D2H costs only (small)

Memory Transfer Pattern (per generation):
    - H2D: 256 tours × n cities × 4 bytes = 1,024n bytes
    - D2H: 256 costs × 8 bytes = 2KB (ONLY costs, not tours!)
    - Total: 1,024n + 2KB bytes per generation
    - Example (n=1000): ~1MB per generation (vs 20MB for naive)

Key Optimization:
    GPU kernel chaining eliminates intermediate transfers:
    OLD: GPU 2-opt → D2H tours → CPU fitness
    NEW: GPU 2-opt → GPU fitness → D2H costs (500x smaller)
