"""
Mutation strategies for Genetic Algorithms.

Implements MutationOperator protocol with various mutation operators:
- SwapMutation: Swap two random cities
- InversionMutation: Reverse random tour segment
- InsertionMutation: Remove city and reinsert elsewhere

All implementations are:
- Backend-agnostic (work with numpy or cupy)
- Type-safe (conform to MutationOperator protocol)
- Preserve tour validity (no duplicate cities, maintain depot)

    """
    Swap two random cities in tour.

    Algorithm:
        1. Select two random positions (excluding depot)
        2. Swap cities at those positions

    Time Complexity: O(1) - constant time operation
    Space Complexity: O(n) - copy of tour

    Properties:
        - Simplest mutation operator
        - Small neighborhood (minimal disruption)
        - Fast (constant time selection and swap)
        - Most common mutation for TSP

    Use Cases:
        - Default mutation for most GA implementations
        - Good balance between exploration and exploitation
        - Works well with moderate mutation rates (0.1-0.2)

    Example:
        >>> strategy = SwapMutation()
        >>> tour = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0]
        >>> mutated = strategy.mutate(tour, problem=None, xp=np)
        >>> # mutated might be: [0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 0]
        >>> # (cities at positions 2 and 4 swapped)

        Phase 3.5 Hybrid Bridge Architecture:
            - S-Task (Sequential): Mutation operations are CPU-only

    Use Cases:
